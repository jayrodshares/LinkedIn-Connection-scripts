Hey ___, 

Thank you for accepting my request! I always enjoy learning from new people. I am currently on the lookout for my next CyberSecurity job and would love to hear more about your experience in the field. Would you be open to a (virtual coffee/coffee/lunch) sometime in the next week or so? 

Looking forward to connecting with you!
